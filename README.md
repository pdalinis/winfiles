winfiles

It is funny how we all spend so much time configuring Windows and Windows applications but are unable to export all those settings.

vsNet2012.vssettings is an export of my almost all my Visual Studio 2012 Pro settings.  If you are going to import, pick and choose which settings you want.

winmerge.ini is a settings file for the nice [winmerge](http://winmerge.org/) tool.  The color settings are an attempt to match the vs.net ones.
